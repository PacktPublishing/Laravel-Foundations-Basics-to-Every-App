## About the Video Course
Laravel is a prominent member of a new generation of web frameworks. It is one of the most popular PHP frameworks and is also free and an open source. Laravel 5 is a substantial upgrade with a lot of new toys, at the same time retaining the features that made Laravel wildly successful. It comes with plenty of architectural as well as design-based changes. Laravel Foundations is a blend of several recipes that will give you all the essential tips you need to build an application. This video course starts by walking you through building an online forum from scratch using Laravel. A forum teaches important concepts such as saving, reading, and updating database entries; working with relationships; adding authentication; and working with views and reusable components. You will also learn how to use routes, connect a database, add comments, and build an authentication system for your forum. By the end of this course you will have the knowledge necessary to put together basic Laravel applications and a foundation you can build on. You will be prepared for later volumes in this series that explore more advanced topics to enhance your application further.
